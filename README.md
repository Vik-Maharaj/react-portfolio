# Vik Maharaj's Web Portfolio (React)

## Description

An online portfolio is an essential tool for a developer. Being able to show off finished projects and demonstrate coding proficiency is a critical part of the job-seeking process.

Enter the purpose of this project: take an existing portfolio website (previously built entirely with HTML and CSS) and revise it using React.js. By doing this, it allows the portfolio to be more versatile, with reusable pieces, and with a more robust and functional "Projects" section that can be easily updated.

The portfolio contains the following features:

- At the top of the webpage, the page loads with name and links to various sections of the pageâ€”all created with react components and navigated using React Router.
- The Projects section of the website (built with cards from the Material UI library) features images of the work samples, and depending where it is clicked, takes the user to the selected deployed website or to the GitHub repo of the selected project.
- The contact section has external links to LinkedIn and GitHub profiles, along with an email form for future use.
